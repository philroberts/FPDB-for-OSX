Step 0 Introduction
-------------------

***********************************************************************************
*** If you are just wanting to use fpdb, please download the                    ***
*** ".exe" package from sourceforge.  Do not follow any of these instructions.  ***
***********************************************************************************

If you do continue the installation, please remember that these instructions
were written on a freshly installed XP system.  fpdb uses python and GTK and
if you already have these installed on your system, overwriting the packages
could break other applications (for example GIMP, which uses GTK toolkit).

This walkthrough was written for XP 32bit, your mileage may vary with Vista and Win7

We will always install the 32-bit packages (even if we have a 64bit windows).
fpdb will NOT work with 64-bit/AMD dependencies


Step 1, basic dependency install
--------------------------------

1.1/ install the following in sequence (accept all default options) there should be no errors !

Python 2.7 ... http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7/python-2.7.msi
matplotlib 1.1.0 ... http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.1.0/matplotlib-1.1.0.win32-py2.7.exe
pywin 217 ... http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build216/pywin32-216.win32-py2.7.exe/download
pypokereval 138 ... http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpdb/files/fpdb/pypoker-eval-win32/pokereval-138.win32-py2.7.exe/download
cdecimal 2.3 ... http://www.bytereef.org/software/mpdecimal/releases/cdecimal-2.3.win32-py2.7.msi
winpaths 0.2 ... http://pypi.python.org/packages/any/w/winpaths/winpaths-0.2.win32.exe#md5=bd99492eb311530c630ec3f26828cd48
python PIL 1.1.7 ... http://effbot.org/downloads/PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.7.exe
7zip 922 ... http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/9.22/7z922.msi/download

1.2/ Add the python install directory to the PATH environment variable on your system
This will depend on your system, and the place where you installed python.

This document might help: http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html

(Developer note - if a later dot-release version of python is used,
 take care, because the pscopg and mysql modules are built against 2.7.0 library)

Step 2, install pygtk and gtk all-in-1 package
----------------------------------------------

2.1/ Download
pygtk 2.24 allin1bundle ... http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi

2.2/ Run installer ***IMPORTANT***: You must select the option to install PyRsvg


Step 3 install git and get fpdb sourcode
----------------------------------------

3.1/ git + fpdbsourcecode installation

Download and install an up to date git client (choose a full installer)
git ... http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list

3.2/ get the fpdb sourcecode

Help is here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/fpdb/index.php?title=Git_intro
fpdb can normally started by selecting run_fpdb.py from the fpdb folder.

3.3 install beautifulsoup
-------------------------

Get the installer here: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/x/xlrd/xlrd-0.9.2.tar.gz

Unpack

from a terminal window:
a) cd to the BeautifulSoup-3.2.1 folder
b) install as follows: "python setup.py install"

3.4 install xlrd
----------------

Get the installer here: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/3.x/BeautifulSoup-3.2.1.tar.gz

Unpack

from a terminal window:
a) cd to the xlrd-0.9.2 folder
b) install as follows: "python setup.py install"

3.5/ next steps
---------------

If you are fpdb developer who wants to build an exe package, go to Step 6 now.

If you just want to run fpdb from source, go to Step 4.


Step 4 Numpy installation
-------------------------

Download and install the following - just accept the default options, there should be no errors !

numpy 1.6.1 ... http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.6.1/numpy-1.6.1-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe/download


Step 5 - Test python and get fpdb sourcecode
--------------------------------------------

5.1/ Open the python command line and make sure everything imports.

>>> import gtk
>>> import win32gui
>>> import numpy
>>> import matplotlib
>>> import winpaths


5.2/ go to Step 7 now, ignore step 6 


6/ Numpy Developer install 
--------------------------

Numpy needs special handling, as by default it will install an optimised version
 for the SSE level of your CPU (SSE3, SSE2 or noSSE).
This means that the completed package will not run on an older CPU.  

For this reason, do not just run the installer.  
We will force a nosse version, to maximise compatibility on older client PC's

6.1/ download the package to the Desktop
 
numpy 1.6.1 ... http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.6.1/numpy-1.6.1-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe/download

6.2/ You are normally wanting to build a package which works on all CPU's, so install for noSSE as follows:

dos> cd Desktop
dos> numpy-1.6.1-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe /arch nosse

6.3/ At the end of the installation, click on "show details" to confirm the installation.

"Target CPU handles SSE2"
"Target CPU handles SSE3"
"nosse install (arch value: nosse)"
"Install NO SSE"
Extract: numpy-1.6.1-nosse.exe... 100%
Execute: "C:\DOCUME~1\user\LOCALS~1\Temp\numpy-1.6.1-nosse.exe"
Completed


Step 7 Optional database installation
-------------------------------------

#*******************************************************************************************#
# Most people can STOP NOW, This step is only needed if you do not want to use the standard # 
# database, or if you are a developer wanting to build an executable package !!!!           #
#*******************************************************************************************#

7.1/ For mysql support, or if you are a exe developer, do this

*** Note that this driver package supports mysql version 5.1.34-win32 and python 2.7.0 only ***

download and install.....
mysql-python 1.2.3 ... http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpdb/files/fpdb/MySQL-python-1.2.3-win32-py2.7/MySQL-python-1.2.3.win32-py2.7.exe/download


7.2/ For postgres support, or if you are a exe developer, do this

*** Note that this driver package supports postgres version 9.2.4 only ***

download and install.....
psycopg2 ... http://www.stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/2.5.0/psycopg2-2.5.win32-py2.7-pg9.2.4-release.exe
(Note: stickpeople is the offical repository, not a community build)


#***********************************************************************************************#
# Almost everyone can STOP NOW, the remaining sections of this document are just for developers #
# who want to build an executable package !!!!                                                  #
#***********************************************************************************************#


Step 8, Install pyICU to display language names
-----------------------------------------------

Download and install...
8.1/ pyICU ... http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ (PyICU-1.2.win32-py2.7.exe)


step 9, install and patch py2exe
--------------------------------

py2exe 0.6.9 ... http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe/download

9.1/ dos> write C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\py2exe\boot_common.py

at line 63, replace:
                    atexit.register(alert, 0,
                                    "See the logfile '%s' for details" % fname,
                                    "Errors occurred")
with:
                    #atexit.register(alert, 0,
                    #                "See the logfile '%s' for details" % fname,
                    #                "Errors occurred")

see http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/StderrLog for technical info about this patch.

9.2/ save and exit


Step 10 install mingw/gcc
-------------------------

10.1/ Install minGW minimal installation
See instructions here....http://www.mingw.org/wiki/InstallationHOWTOforMinGW
10.2/ Alter the windows path to ensure that command "gcc" executes from the DOS prompt


Step 11, fixup pytz to work in an executable package
----------------------------------------------------

pytz was installed as part of the matplotlib package, but needs fixing to allow runtime access to timezone definition files.  pytz is hard-coded to search in the directory from which the pytz .py modules are being run.
In a py2exe package, this directory is actually a library.zip container file, so windows cannot find the timezone definitions, and will crash the app.

We need to make a one-line change to pytz to search in the current working directory (which is not a container), and not the application directory.
The py2exe script copies the timezone datafiles into the package folder pyfpdb/zoneinfo.

Thanks to Jeff Peck <peck.jeff <at> gmail.com> on the py2exe mailing list for documenting this problem and solution.

11.1/ dos> write C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pytz\__init__.py 
11.2/ At about line 94 replace the following line(s):

    filename = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                            'zoneinfo', *name_parts)

with this section of code (which supports exe-building _and_ sourcecode running on the build system):

    #py2exe installs need this syntax
    #
    filename = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'zoneinfo', *name_parts)
    
    #sourcecode installs need this syntax
    #
    if not os.path.exists(filename):
        filename = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                                'zoneinfo', *name_parts)


11.3/ Save and exit



Step 12 Get the fpdb GIT tree and prepare for build
---------------------------------------------------

12.1/ Take a copy of the GIT tree; the remaining steps will assume that the fpdb folder has been copied onto the Desktop

12.2/ Set version number of build folder
dos> cd Desktop\fpdb\packaging\windows
dos> write py2exe_setup.py
change the value of the variable "fpdbver" and save the file

12.3/ edit pyfpdb/card_path.py

Define this function (overwrite any existing definition):

def deck_path():
    return os.path.dirname(sys.executable)


Step 13 Run py2exe to generate fpdb.exe
---------------------------------------

13.1/ Run the script to create the fpdb.exe bundle

dos> cd Desktop\fpdb\packaging\windows
dos> c:\python27\python.exe py2exe_setup.py py2exe

wait a while, watch lots of copying and whatever.

13.2/ You might get prompted for the GTK folder.
Enter the absolute path, e.g. c:\GTK

13.3/ If there are no errors reported, it has probably worked, we will test soon.

Build notes:

There is a warning about dll's not included  "umath.pyd - c:\Python27\lib\site-packages\numpy\core\umath.pyd"
 - reason for this is not understood at present.  (Umath is apparently included in the built package).


Step 14 Drag out the completed bundle
------------------------------------

py2exe creates a new folder for the created software bundle, drag this out to the desktop for ease of working.

14.1/ Drag Desktop\fpdb\packaging\windows\fpdb-n.nn.nnn to Desktop\


Step 15 Compress to executable archive
--------------------------------------

15.1/ Rightclick on fpdb executable folder, select 7zip Add to archive... select SFX archive option switch
15.2/ This executable will be the released software


Step 16 basic testing
---------------------

16.1/ Open the Desktop\fpdb-n.nn.nnn  folder
16.2/ In explorer...tools...folder options...View uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types" 
16.3/ Double click run_fpdb.bat
16.4/ hopefully, fpdb will run 

16.5/ check the contents of pyfpdb\fpdb.exe.log
16.6/ check the contents of fpdb_prerun.txt
16.7/ check the contents of C:\Documents and Settings\xxxxxxx\Application Data\fpdb\log

Note: msvcp90.dll was provided by the python runtime package, so we don't have to install the separate package from Microsoft.
End-users will, however need the dependency.
